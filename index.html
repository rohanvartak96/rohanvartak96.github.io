                            "Move Fast" comes to mind when I have to describe Rohan. When I joined Meta, I was Rohan's manager. He was instrumental in onboarding me successfully to the Communities Team. I was impressed with how fast he shipped quality data products and his meticulousness. He was passionate about his work and had built deep relationships with XFN partners. Rohan was an "idea" guy and it was evident in team meetings and brainstorming sessions when his suggestions helped others in building their product. One thing that jumped out about Rohan was analysis acumen that naturally led him to pursue a career in data science at Meta. I knew the team will miss him and his contributions that helped all of us move forward. I for one will be watching his career closely at Meta or wherever his journey takes him now and in the future."

We were the first Data Scientist and Data Engineer on the team, respectively. While new to Meta, Rohan onboarded himself amazingly fast and quickly became an indispensable part of the team. He had great strategic thinking and never shied away from speaking up and sharing his perspectives; he's the fastest Data Engineer that I had worked with during my almost 5 years at Meta who had strong execution and fast turnaround when needed. Rohan communicated well, and was always readily available. It was a huge loss for our team when Rohan left our team (literally everyone misses him), and I cannot say enough how much I hope our paths cross again in the future."
